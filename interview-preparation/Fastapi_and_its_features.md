FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of **Starlette** for the web parts and **Pydantic** for the data parts. FastAPI is designed to be **fast**, **intuitive**, and **robust**, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs, microservices, and backend applications that need performance and data validation.

Fastapi uses asgii, which is just an interface between yuor application and the server.

## 🔍 **What is FastAPI?**

FastAPI is a Python web framework specifically built for:

* **Fast development** of APIs
* **Automatic validation** of request and response data using Python's type hints
* **Automatic generation** of interactive API documentation (Swagger & ReDoc)
* **High performance** thanks to its use of **asyncio** and **Starlette**

---

## 🚀 **Core Features of FastAPI**

### 1. **Type Hints & Data Validation with Pydantic**

* Use Python type hints to define request/response bodies.
* Automatic parsing and validation of data using Pydantic models.
* Error messages are informative and standards-based.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

---

### 2. **Automatic Interactive API Documentation**

* **Swagger UI** (at `/docs`) and **ReDoc** (at `/redoc`) are automatically generated.
* The documentation is interactive and allows testing endpoints from the browser.

---

### 3. **Asynchronous Support (async/await)**

* Full support for asynchronous code using `async def`.
* Enables writing non-blocking code and scaling efficiently.

```python
@app.get("/async-task/")
async def do_task():
    await some_async_function()
    return {"status": "done"}
```

---

### 4. **Fast and High Performance**

* Benchmark tests show FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks, only slower than Node.js and Go.
* Based on Starlette and Uvicorn for high-speed performance.

---

### 5. **Dependency Injection System**

* Cleanly inject shared logic like authentication, DB sessions, etc., using a built-in dependency system.

```python
from fastapi import Depends

def get_db():
    db = DBSession()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(db: DBSession = Depends(get_db)):
    return db.query(Item).all()
```

---

### 6. **Security & OAuth2 Integration**

* Built-in tools for handling authentication (OAuth2, JWT, HTTP Basic, etc.).
* Secure endpoints with dependencies.

---

### 7. **Request & Response Models**

* Automatic serialization and validation of request data and responses.

```python
@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=Item)
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    ...
```

---

### 8. **Background Tasks**

* Run background tasks like sending emails or notifications without blocking the main request.

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks

def write_log(message: str):
    with open("log.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(message)

@app.post("/send-notification/")
async def send_notification(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    background_tasks.add_task(write_log, "Notification sent")
    return {"message": "Notification scheduled"}
```

---

### 9. **Middleware Support**

* Add middleware to execute code before or after each request.

```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def add_process_time_header(request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Process-Time"] = "0.1"
    return response
```

---

### 10. **Extensive WebSocket Support**

* Full support for real-time applications using WebSockets.

```python
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text("Hello!")
```

---

### 11. **GraphQL Support**

* You can use libraries like Graphene to integrate GraphQL with FastAPI.

---

## 🔄 **FastAPI Request Lifecycle**

Understanding how a request is processed in FastAPI:

```
Client → ASGI Server (Uvicorn) → Middleware → Router → Dependencies → Endpoint Logic → Response Model → Response Sent
```

### 1. **ASGI Server (Uvicorn)**

* Uvicorn receives the request and passes it to the FastAPI application.

### 2. **Middleware**

* Pre-processing like logging, headers, authentication can occur here.

### 3. **Routing**

* URL is matched to a route (endpoint function).

### 4. **Dependency Resolution**

* Before the endpoint is executed, FastAPI evaluates any declared dependencies.

### 5. **Endpoint Execution**

* Endpoint function is run (`async` or regular `def`).

### 6. **Serialization**

* Return value is serialized based on the response model or type annotations.

### 7. **Response**

* Response is returned to Uvicorn and sent back to the client.
