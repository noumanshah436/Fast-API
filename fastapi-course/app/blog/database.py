# **********************************

# SQLALCHAMY_DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///./blog.db'

# Hereâ€™s how to read this path:

# sqlite: Specifies that SQLite is the database type.
# ///: Indicates that the database is stored in a file, not in memory. The triple slash /// is used for relative paths in SQLite.
# ./blog.db: The relative path to the database file, blog.db, located in the current working directory (denoted by ./).
